# CogniteTimeseriesTransforms
This is a simple project to demonstrate the capabilities of simple discrete time series transforms for the Valhall field data (public data from Cognite)

As of now, I have deviced a test to querry the assets and the associated data series. The time analysis consits of a Bode plot, and a Nyquist plot, however some more analysis regarding noize is to be done.
